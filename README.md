# OperationsGateway API
This is an API built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to work with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and the data stored as part of the OperationsGateway project.


## Environment Setup
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used to manage the dependencies of this API. To install Poetry, follow [the instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer) from their documentation.

To install the project's dependencies, execute `poetry install`. The dependencies and the code in this repo are compatible with Python 3.6+.

## Nox Sessions
Like [DataGateway API](https://github.com/ral-facilities/datagateway-api), this repository contains a [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes) file (`noxfile.py`) which exists in the root level of this repository. There are a handful of sessions which help with repetitive tasks during development To install Nox, use the following command:

```bash
pip install --user --upgrade nox
```

To run a specific Nox session, use the following:

```bash
nox -s [SESSION NAME]
```

Currently, the following Nox sessions have been created:
- `black` - this uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format Python code to a pre-defined style.
- `lint` - this uses [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) with a number of additional plugins (see the included `noxfile.py` to see which plugins are used) to lint the code to keep it Pythonic. `.flake8` configures `flake8` and the plugins.
- `safety` - this uses [safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) to check the dependencies (pulled directly from Poetry) for any known vulnerabilities. This session gives the output in a full ASCII style report.
- `tests` - this uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to execute the automated tests in `test/`. There are currently no automated tests written for this repository however.

## API Configuration
In `operationsgateway_api/`, there is an example config file (`config.yml.example`). Copy this example so `config.yml` exists in the same directory level and edit the configuration as needed for your system. There is also a logging configuration file (`logging.ini.example`). Follow the same procedure as the config file as to set up the logging.

## Authentication Configuration

The authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) which require a private and public key pair to encrypt and decrypt the tokens. The keys can be generated by navigating to a directory and typing the command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa
```

Enter the path for the file as `id_rsa` to create the keys in the current directory rather than in your home directory.

Press enter twice when prompted for the password so as not to set one.

The key should be OpenSSH encoded - this format is generated by default in Rocky 8. You can check whether your key is in the correct format by checking the start of the private key; it should be `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`.

Then edit the ```private_key_path``` and ```public_key_path``` settings in the ```auth``` section of the ```config.yml``` file to reflect the location where these keys have been created.

### Adding User Accounts

The authentication system requires any users of the system to have an account set up in the database. Two types of user login are currently supported: federal ID logins for "real" users, and "local" logins for functional accounts.

To add some test accounts to the system, use the user data stored in `util/users_for_mongoimport.json`. Use the following command to import those users into the database:

```bash
mongoimport --db='opsgateway' --collection='users' --mode='upsert' --file='util/users_for_mongoimport.json'
```

Using the `upsert` mode allows you to update existing users with any changes that are made (e.g. added an authorised route to their entry) and any new users are inserted as normal. The command's output states the number of documents that have been added and how many have been updated.

## API Startup
To start the API, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run python -m operationsgateway_api.src.main
```

Assuming default configuration, the API will exist on 127.0.0.1:8000. You can visit `/docs` in a browser which will give an OpenAPI interface detailing each of the endpoints and an option to send requests to them. Alternatively, you can send requests to the API using a platform such as Postman to construct and save specific requests.
